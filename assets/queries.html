            <label for="first">Why do I get sick?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>When you get sick, part or all of your body is not working as it should. The cause of sickness can come from inside your body or from the outside world. Diseases that start on the inside are usually inherited in the genes that you receive from your parents, which make up the master plan that determines how your body will grow and run. Abnormal development or functioning of different body systems is the cause of many chronic diseases.</p>

            <label for="second">How do the disease-causing germs invade my body?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Your skin is a wonderful protective barrier that prevents many of the disease-causing germs that you run into each day from entering your body. Only when you have an opening in your skin—like a cut or a scrape—are germs likely to enter there. Most germs enter through your mouth and nose, making their way farther into your body through your respiratory or digestive tracts. But even then, certain chemicals in body tissues and fluids keep many harmful germs from causing problems. When an infection does begin—with the germs multiplying inside your body—your immune systemleaps into action to get rid of the foreign organisms. Your white blood cells produce special substances called antibodies that attack and destroy the invaders, helping you to recover.</p>

            <label for="third">What are allergies?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>An allergic reaction is a reaction to a substance that is typically harmless to most other people. Allergies happen when a person’s immune system overreacts to a substance that the person has breathed in, touched, or eaten. Allergens—the antigens that bring on an allergic reaction—may be foods, medications, plants or animals, chemicals, dust, or molds. Some common allergic reactions are hay fever, allergic conjunctivitis (an eye reaction), asthma, pet-dander allergies, and skin reactions, such as hives. A common cause for allergies are dust mites, a large part of household dust. If they are breathed in by an allergic person, the body parts of the dead mites can trigger asthma, a lung condition that causes a person to have difficulty breathing. Cat and dog dander, or skin flakes, can cause an allergic reaction, such as sneezing, wheezing, and runny eyes and nose. Common food allergy triggers are the proteins in cow’s milk, eggs, peanuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, and tree nuts.</p>

            <label for="fourth">What are antibiotics?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Antibiotics are medicines that help the human body fight bacteria, either by killing the offending germs directly or by weakening them so that the body’s own immune system can fight and kill them more easily. The most widely known antibiotic is penicillin, which is made from mold. Penicillin kills bacteria by interfering with the formation of the cell walls or cell contents of the bacteria.</p>

            <label for="fifth">Why is exercise important to health?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Exercise is good for your health. Regular physical activity helps a person have stronger bones and muscles, helps control body fat, helps prevent certain illnesses, and contributes to a good outlook on life. Regular exercise helps promote digestion and a good night’s sleep. When children exercise as part of their busy lives, they are better equipped to manage the physical and emotional challenges of a busy day. Many governments and other organizations recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity every week.</p>

            <label for="sixth">Why is sleep necessary for good health?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Scientists do not know exactly why people need sleep, but studies show that sleep is necessary for survival. Sleep appears to be necessary for the nervous system to work properly. While too little sleep one night may leave us feeling drowsy and unable to concentrate the next day, a long period of too little sleep leads to poor memory and physical performance. Hallucinations (experiencing things that aren’t really there), vision problems, and mood swings may develop if sleep deprivation continues.</p>

                <p>Food safety (or food hygiene) is used as a scientific method/discipline describing handling, preparation, and storage of food in ways that prevent foodborne illness. The occurrence of two or more cases of a similar illness resulting from the ingestion of a common food is known as a food-borne disease outbreak.</p>
